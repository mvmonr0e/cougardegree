# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## Installation & Running (Windows PowerShell)

### Step 1: Start Backend Server

```powershell
# Open PowerShell in the project root directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the backend server
npm start
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ CougarDegree Backend running on port 3001
ðŸ“Š Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
ðŸŽ“ Degree planning: http://localhost:3001/api/degree-plan
ðŸ“š Loaded 40+ degree programs
```

**Keep this PowerShell window open!**

### Step 2: Start Frontend Server

Open a **NEW** PowerShell window:

```powershell
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the frontend server
npm start
```

The frontend will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Use the Application

1. Select your major from the dropdown
2. Choose your start semester
3. Enter any courses you've already completed (comma-separated)
   - Example: `ENGL 1301, MATH 2413, COSC 1336`
4. Click "Generate My Degree Plan"
5. View your personalized 4-year schedule!

## Testing the Scheduler

To verify the scheduling algorithm works correctly:

```powershell
cd backend
node test-scheduler.js
```

This will run automated tests and show:
- âœ… Schedule generation for new students
- âœ… Schedule with completed courses
- âœ… Prerequisite validation
- âœ… Credit distribution across semesters

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- **Error**: `Cannot find module 'express'`
  - **Fix**: Run `npm install` in the backend directory

- **Error**: `Port 3001 is already in use`
  - **Fix**: Close any other app using port 3001, or change the PORT in `.env`

### Frontend won't start
- **Error**: `Cannot find module 'express'`
  - **Fix**: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory

- **Error**: `Port 3000 is already in use`
  - **Fix**: The frontend server will offer to use a different port, press Y

### Cannot connect to backend
- **Error**: `Failed to fetch` or `Network Error`
  - **Fix**: Make sure backend server is running on port 3001
  - **Check**: Visit http://localhost:3001/health in your browser

### No majors showing in dropdown
- **Issue**: Dropdown shows "Select your major" but no options
  - **Fix**: Check backend console for errors loading JSON files
  - **Check**: Ensure `backend/degrees/` folder has JSON files

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Enter courses exactly as they appear**: Use format like `COSC 1336`, not `cosc1336`
2. **Separate multiple courses with commas**: `MATH 2413, ENGL 1301, HIST 1301`
3. **Include all completed courses**: The more info you provide, the better the schedule
4. **Review prerequisites**: Hover over courses to see prerequisite requirements
5. **Consult an advisor**: This tool is for planning only - always verify with your advisor
