  - Required labs: BIOL 3311 + advanced lab choice

## Validation Results

### Before Update
- ❌ Credit mismatches (incomplete course lists)
- ❌ Generic "ELECTIVE X" placeholders
- ❌ Missing prerequisite chains

### After Update
- ✅ All 3 files pass validation with 0 errors
- ✅ Correct credit totals match official UH requirements
- ✅ Complete prerequisite chains - no broken dependencies
- ✅ Scheduler generates valid 8-semester plans
- ✅ 0 prerequisite violations in test runs

## Testing Results

Comprehensive scheduler testing shows:
- **Prerequisite Enforcement**: 100% accurate - no violations
- **Credit Distribution**: Balanced 15-18 credits per semester
- **Course Sequencing**: Proper level progression (1000→2000→3000→4000)
- **Lab Pairing**: Labs correctly paired with corresponding lectures
- **Elective Structure**: Proper advanced elective requirements maintained

## Files Created/Updated

1. `backend/degrees/cosc_bs_ACCURATE.json` → `cosc_bs.json`
2. `backend/degrees/mechanical_bs_ACCURATE.json` → `mechanical_bs.json`
3. `backend/degrees/bio_bs_ACCURATE.json` → `bio_bs.json`

## Data Sources

All data sourced from official UH Publications catalogs:
- Computer Science: Catalog ID 44, Program ID 15505
- Mechanical Engineering: Catalog ID 44, Program ID 15402  
- Biology: Catalog ID 56, Program ID 18893

## Remaining Work

46 other degree programs still use generic electives. These can be updated using the same web-scraping methodology:
1. Search for official UH catalog page
2. Fetch full requirements with `fetch_webpage`
3. Parse course lists, prerequisites, and credit hours
4. Create accurate JSON file
5. Validate with `validate-data.js`
6. Test with scheduler

## Graduation Rules Included

Each degree file now includes official graduation requirements:
- Minimum GPA requirements
- Prerequisite grade requirements (C- or better)
- Maximum withdrawal limits
- Advanced hour requirements
- Residency rules
- Transfer credit limits

## Next Steps

To extend this work to more majors:
1. Identify priority degrees (high enrollment)
2. Locate official catalog pages
3. Use web scraping tools to fetch data
4. Create accurate JSON files following the established format
5. Validate and test each degree
6. Replace placeholder files

## Benefits

✨ **Accurate Scheduling**: Students get realistic course sequences
✨ **Prerequisite Safety**: No impossible schedules with broken chains
✨ **Official Compliance**: Data matches UH catalog exactly
✨ **Future-Proof**: Source URLs documented for updates
✨ **Validation Tools**: Automated checking prevents data errors
